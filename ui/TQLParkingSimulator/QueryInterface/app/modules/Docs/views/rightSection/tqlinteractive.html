        <p>TQL Interactive is the teaser version for early users to try TQL out. Go to<br/><span class="linkblue">http://tql.atomiton.com/#/home </span>and start using TQL queries. </p>
        <p>This interactive shell lets you run a few most frequently used thing queries and see the results.</p>
        <p>When you click on “Tutorial”, TQL Interactive will ask if you want to open a visualizer window. The visualizer will display the simulated smart parking case created by Atomiton’s IoT Simulator.</p>
        <p>The queries will be executed against this smart parking simulation. Go to <br/> <span class="linkblue">http://tql.atomiton.com/#/iot_simulator</span> to see the detailed set up of Smart Parking. </p>
        <p>The results of the queries will be showed at the bottom window, and the result of the actions will be apparent from the visualizer (e.g. if your query takes an action to turn lights on or off).</p>
